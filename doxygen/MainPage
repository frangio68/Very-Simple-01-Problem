\section intro Introduction

This file is a short user manual for the distribution of VerySimple01Problem,
a small class for solving the simplest problem in 0-1 variables. While this
is hardly interesting, the class also "efficiently" enumerates any given
subset of all the (2^n) solutions of the problem in objective function value
order. This has a few possible applications, and it might be useful as a
"blueprint" to someone in need to do the same (enumerate the solutions in
objective function value order) for other combinatorial problems with
appropriate structure, e.g. some path and matching problems. The ideas behind
the approach are fairly extensively described in the interface.

\subsection disclaimer Standard Disclaimer

This code is provided "as is", without any explicit or implicit warranty
that it will properly behave or it will suit you needs. Although codes
reaching the distribution phase have usually been extensively tested, we
cannot guarantee that they are absolutely bug-free (who can?). Any use of
the codes is at you own risk: in no case we could be considered liable for
any damage or loss you would eventually suffer, either directly or indirectly,
for having used this code. More details about the non-warranty attached to
this code are available in the license description file.

The code also comes with a "good will only" support: feel free to contact us
for any comments/critics/bug report/request help you may have, we will be
happy to try to answer and help you. But we cannot spend much time solving
your problems, just the time to read a couple of e-mails and send you fast
suggestions if the problem is easily solvable. Apart from that, we can't offer
you any support.
